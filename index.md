# Hi there,

My name is Wan-Ting a.k.a. Silvia, a python developer came from Taiwan and live in East London.

I graduated from National Taipei University of Technology with master degree in Electronic Engineering and from Tamkang University with bachelor degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering. 

Raised in a family of electrical engineers, I used to implement multiple embedded system projects in **C** and **Python** on Linux for IoT area. 
I'd been a software engineer in manufacturing industry almost 4 years. In last job, I mainly wrote python code, **Dockerfile** and groovy scripts on **Jenkins** for developing. 

Recently, I switch to research/web application industry. Love and believe the sentence "Technical provides convenient". I love to implement exciting products for all human beings!
